# Quez

A quiz app

## Pre-requisites
- Ruby 3.3.5
- bundler
- imagemagick or libvips

## Configuration

Configuration ENV variables are managed via [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) and examples could be seen in the `.env.local.example` file.

## Running

The recommended way for running this application in development is to use Foreman. This is useful for running all the components required.

First, make sure everything is setup:

```
./bin/setup
```

To run everything in for development purposes, just run:

```
./bin/dev
```

For production use, this application will be run within a container and Foreman will not be used.

## Tests and linting

To run tests for this application, you can simply execute as needed.

```
./bin/rails test
```

Run Rubocop via:

```
./bin/rubocop
```
